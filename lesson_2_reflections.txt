What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a .git folder which stores metadata about your git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a more precise file area where we can specify changes
that we actually want in git. It is a temporary space between the cwd and repo.
It allows us to see actually what we are committing.
